-- for this you will need a textbox and button in a gui, a LocalScript in the gui, a event named "KickEvent" in replicated storage under a folder named "Events" and a Server side script

-- Local Scipt inside of button gui

local button = script.Parent
local textbox = script.Parent.Parent.Textbox
local event = game.ReplicatedStorage.Events.KickEvent

button.MouseButton1Down:Connect(Function()
  event:FireServer(textbox.text)
end)



-- Server script, placed anywhere that it can be.

local event = game.ReplicatedStorage.Events.KickEvent

event.OnServerEvent:Connect(Function(player, plrtokick)
  local PlayerToKick = plrtokick:FindFirstChild(game.Players)
  if PlayerToKick then
    PlayerToKick:Kick("you were kicked from the game") -- "" being the reason
  else
  print("Player not found")
end)
